# Cracking The Code: Regex Demystified

In a coding galaxy not so far away, regular expressions, or regex for short, emerge as the guiding force of pattern recognition and text manipulation. These powerful tools allow programmers to bring balance to the chaos that can be data validation and text processing. In this presentation, prepare to embark on an syntactic journey into the formidable realm of regular expressions. Together, we will deconstruct their intricate components and uncover the extraordinary applications they hold.

## Summary

In this presentation, we will explore the fundamental components of regular expressions and their usage. We will cover topics such as anchors, quantifiers, the OR operator, character classes, flags, grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy matching, boundaries, back-references, and look-ahead and look-behind assertions. Below is an example of a regex pattern we will analyze:

'''js
^([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})$
'''

## Regex Components

### Anchors

In regular expressions, anchors are special characters or symbols used to specify positions within a string where a match should occur. Anchors do not match any characters themselves; instead, they define the relationship between the pattern and the input string. There are two common types of anchors in regex: the '^' anchor and the '$' anchor.  The '^' anchor is used to match the start of a line or string and asserts that the pattern must match at the start of the string.  In this case that refers to the pattern '([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+)', which represents the username of the email.  The 

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers like *, +, and ? are essential for specifying the number of times a character or group should be matched. We'll dive into their usage and examples.

### OR Operator

The OR operator (|) allows us to match one of several alternatives. We'll demonstrate how to use it effectively in regex patterns.

### Character Classes

Character classes like [a-zA-Z] and \d help us match specific sets of characters. We'll explore various character classes and their applications.

### Flags

Flags like i and g can modify the behavior of regular expressions. We'll discuss common flags and their impact on matching.

### Grouping and Capturing

Regex groups ( ) are used for capturing and grouping parts of a pattern. We'll explain their importance and demonstrate capturing techniques.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions [ ] allow us to create custom character classes. We'll see how to use them for precise matching

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy and lazy matching affect the way regex handles repetition. We'll examine their differences and when to use each.

### Boundaries

Word boundaries \b and non-word boundaries \B are crucial for precise matching within text. We'll illustrate their usage.

### Back-references

Back-references (\1, \2, etc.) enable us to refer to previously captured groups within a regex pattern. We'll explore practical applications.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and look-behind assertions ((?=...) and (?<=...)) allow us to match text based on what comes before or after it. We'll delve into their advanced uses.
